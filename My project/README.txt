README "Fast to Class" game

You are a student at Marsden High School, and you are late for your SDD class! You don't have much time to get to the classroom on the 4th floor, so you better hurry! Avoid angering the teacher and save your attendance before it's too late!


For non-marsden players:
"Fast to Class" was the catchphrase of Marsden High School during an initiative that sought to move students from breaks to class more efficiently by ending breaks a few minutes early for students to move in.
