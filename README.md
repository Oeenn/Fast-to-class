Synopsis:

You are a student at Marsden High School in 2040.

You are running late to your Software Class on Level 4 North (like normal), and you must hurry to get there on time (or your attendance will drop below 80%)!
Work your way through the obstacles that block your path to class, including (but not limited to) teachers, Yr7s, spilled JuiceBombs and v*pes!
